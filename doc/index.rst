Welcome to dh-virtualenv's documentation!
=========================================

Overview
--------

``dh-virtualenv`` is a tool that aims to combine Debian packaging with
self-contained Python software deployment in a pre-built virtualenv.
To do this, the project extends debhelper's build sequence by providing
the new ``dh_virtualenv`` command.

This new command effectively replaces the following commands in the default sequence:

 * ``dh_auto_install``
 * ``dh_python2``
 * ``dh_pycentral``
 * ``dh_pysupport``

In the debhelper build sequence, ``dh_virtualenv`` is inserted right after ``dh_perl``.
